## Introduction
This project was originally made in college as a final project for a programming course. After college I decided to remake it to be a little cleaner and have 60fps instead of 10fps. I added a bit of game theory to the creation of it and runs half decent now. 

My goal for this project was to showcase I know how to both create games with basic tools and refactor old unknown code (lets be honest I didn't comment well enough originally). 

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* C#
* .NET
