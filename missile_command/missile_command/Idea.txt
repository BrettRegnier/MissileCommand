Replace destination and find another way, perhaps they need to calculate it itself. Since it should be randomly shot at the ground
but also needs to consistently hit player objects on the ground.

They need to have a destination point, I should store those static position in something.... STATIC... hint.
Make the same thing as normal missle command for the ground with 3 specific spots.

Iffy on dimensions. They should probably set themselves? But the factory does need to be the one MAKING it.	`
